# AI Image Detector
Wow thanks for reading about my first ever public GitHub project.
This project uses a dataset of about 10,000 images with a mixture of AI generated and real photos (not AI generated). Using the MLJ package written in Julia code I created a Neural Network and trained the network to distinguish between AI generated and real photos. The end result was a nearly 99% accuracy on all photos.
